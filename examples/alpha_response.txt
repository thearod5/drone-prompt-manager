The search area is divided into two types of terrains: waterways and woodlands. According to the mission objectives, waterways are the highest priority for search. The drone with the thermal camera (Blue) will be used during dusk or nighttime conditions. However, since the weather is sunny, all drones can be used effectively.

The drones will start from A1 and will be assigned to different areas to maximize the search efficiency. The drones will be assigned to the closest charging station to their last search area to maximize battery life. The flight plans will be created in such a way that at least one drone is always searching.

The drone Purple has a flotation device, so it will be assigned to search the waterways. The other drones will be assigned to search the woodlands. The drones will search 3 cells during a 30-minute flight and then return to the closest charging station.

The flight plans will be created in such a way that the drones cover the entire search area in the shortest time possible. The drones will be assigned to different areas to avoid overlap and maximize the search efficiency.
