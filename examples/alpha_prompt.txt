# Mission Description
A critical search and rescue mission is underway to locate a missing person in a designated area. The search zone has been organized into a grid format 28 cells wide and 16 cells high. Coordinate A1 is the top-left corner and P28 is bottom-right corner. A cell in the top row is not adjacent to a cell in the bottom row.  There is no wrapping.  This is also true of the leftmost and rightmost columns.  They are not adjacent to each other.

Each drone can fly for 30 minutes before needing to recharge batteries. All drones start their first flight at the launch pad.  All subsequent flights start at recharging stations.

Each flight consists of three stages:
A) Flying from its current cell to the starting cell of its search.
B) A series of adjacent cells representing its search. It can search 3 cells.
C) A flight from the final cell searched to a charging station or back to the launch point which is also a charging station.


Search RULES are
A) IF a cell has already been searched it MUST NOT be searched again in this plan.


# Search strategies
A) Minimize the distance from the last searched cell to its charging station.
B) Order of Search Priorities
    i.) Search bodies of water first.
    ii.) Search woods next.
    iii.) Search areas immediately adjacent to woods.



# Drones

All drones start at the launch point.  The launch point is an additional battery charging station.

# TASKS
A) First, please explain what you understand about the mission by answering three questions:
    A) How should flights be prioritized?
    B) Can drones search cells that have already been searched?
    C) How could battery usage be optimized?
 Enclose your answer inside of <reasoning></reasoning>
B) Next, please plan the first flight for each of the 5 drones.  Remember they each of them must start at the launch pad, cover approximately 3 cells, and then return to a charging cell. Structure output as follows:
<drone>
	<id>[Drone ID e.g., Purple]</id>
	<flight round>1</flight round>
	<a>[Starting Cell]</a>
	<b>[List of cells to search separated by commas]</b>
	<c>[Ending Cell]</c>
</drone>
