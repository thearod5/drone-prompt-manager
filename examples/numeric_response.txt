The search area is divided into two types of terrains: waterways and woodlands. According to the mission objectives, waterways are the highest priority for search. The drones available for the mission are Red, Blue, Purple, Yellow, and Green. The Blue drone has a thermal camera which can be useful during dusk or nighttime conditions, but since the weather is sunny today, this feature will not be utilized. The Purple drone has a flotation device, which can be useful in waterways.

The search area is divided into blocks that are inaccessible due to terrain. These blocks are primarily located in the waterways and woodlands. The drones will need to navigate around these blocks to search the area effectively.

The flight plans will be constructed to maximize the battery life of the drones. Each drone can search up to 3 cells during a 30-minute flight and can travel a maximum of 8 cells horizontally or vertically in one flight. The drones will start from the origin point at (1, 1) and will return to the closest charging station after searching 3 cells. The charging stations are located at coordinates (1, 1), (1, 14), (8, 14), and (8, 1).

The flight plans will be designed to ensure that at least one drone is always searching. The drones will be dispatched in a staggered manner to ensure continuous search coverage. The drones will be assigned to different areas of the search zone to maximize coverage and efficiency.

The flight plans will prioritize the waterways, followed by the woodlands. The drones will search the waterways first, then move on to the woodlands. The Purple drone, equipped with a flotation device, will be assigned to search the waterways. The other drones will be assigned to search the woodlands.
